## Usage

### Adding a New Route

1. **Create a new page component:**

   Create a file in the `src/pages/` directory, e.g., `About.js`:

    ```jsx
    // src/pages/About.js
    import React from 'react';

    const About = () => {
      return <div>About Us</div>;
    };

    export default About;
    ```

2. **Add the route to `App.js`:**

    ```jsx
    // src/App.js
    import React from 'react';
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
    import Navbar from './components/Navbar';
    import Home from './pages/Home';
    import About from './pages/About';

    const App = () => {
      return (
        <Router>
          <Navbar />
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
            <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
          </Routes>
        </Router>
      );
    };

    export default App;
    ```

### Customizing the Navbar

The Navbar component is located in `src/components/Navbar.js`. Customize the links and styling as needed.

## Styling

Tailwind CSS classes are used throughout the project. Customize styles by editing `tailwind.config.js`.
